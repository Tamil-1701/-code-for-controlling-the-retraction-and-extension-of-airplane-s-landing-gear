#Implement the Code for controlling the retraction and extension of Airplane’s landing gear.

Aim:

To implement the code for control retraction and extension of airplanes landing gear implementation using Finite State Machine (FSM).

Objective:

Controlling the direction of valve.
Controlling the retraction and extension of airplane’s landing gear.

Principle:

The airplane has three gears for landing such as nose gear, left gear and right gear.
There is a hydraulic pump which is exerting pressure tothe gears to bring it down or pull it up using electrical driven pump.
When the direction of the valve is down then it is landed or gear down position.
Similarly when the direction of valve is up then it is in rising gear or taking off.
When gear is up then light status is off.
Gear is down then the light status is green.
Gear is raising or lowering then the colour of light is red.
